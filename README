Hdf5io Python module 
====================
People familiar with Matlab(TM) and its load and save functions will find 
themselves at home with this small python module, I guess. It makes it 
possible to save your variables in "workspace" or from within a function 
to a hdf5 file, and later load them back in again.

Based on pyTables to be able to save and load data to/from hdf5 files.

Usage examples
==============

1. hdf5save
-----------
1a. The most simple call to hdf5save is to type:

 hdf5save()  

This will save all the user created variables in the current scope to a 
hdf5-file called "hdf5io.h5".

1b. To define a file name, for instance called "file.h5" to save the 
variables to:

 hdf5save("file.h5")  

1c. To save specific variables in current scope to a hdf5-file called 
"file.h5" type:

 hdf5save("file.h5","var varstring")    

or:

 hdf5save("file.h5","var1","var2")   

1d. Names of variables to be saved can also be specified using wildcards '*':

 hdf5save("file.h5","v*")   

1e. Appending data to an existing hdf5 file is also possible. To invoke this
special mode add a + sign at the beginning of the file name:

 hdf5save("+file.h5","var")   

2. hdf5ls
-----------
To show the contents of a hdf5 file called "file.h5" type:

 hdf5ls("file.h5")

3. hdf5load
-----------
3a. As with the save function above, the most simple way to call hdf5load is
to type:

 hdf5load()

This will load all variables from a file called "hdf5io.h5".

3b. To load the variables from a hdf5 file called "file.h5" type:

 hdf5load("file.h5")
 
3c. To load a specific variable from a hdf5 file called "file.h5" type:

 hdf5load("file.h5","var2")

or:

 hdf5load("file.h5","var1","var2")   

3d. Names of variables to be loaded can also be specified using wildcards '*':

 hdf5load("file.h5","v*")   

3e. To load variables in a specific group  from a hdf5 file called "file.h5" 
type:

 hdf5load("file.h5",None,"/group1")

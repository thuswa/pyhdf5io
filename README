Hdf5io Python module 
====================
People familiar with Matlab(TM) and its load and save functions will find 
themselves at home with this small python module, I guess. It makes it 
possible to save your variables in "workspace" or from within a function 
to a hdf5 file, and later load them back in again.

Based on pyTables to be able to save and load data to/from hdf5 files.

Usage examples
==============

1. hdf5save
-----------
1a. To save all user create variables in current scope to a hdf5-file called 
"file.h5" type:

 hdf5save("file.h5")  

1b. To save specific variables in current scope to a hdf5-file called 
"file.h5" type:

 hdf5save("file.h5","var varstring")    

or:

 hdf5save("file.h5","var1","var2")   

1c. Names of variables to be saved can also be specified using wildcards '*':

 hdf5save("file.h5","v*")   

2. hdf5ls
-----------
To show the contents of a hdf5 file called "file.h5" type:

 hdf5ls("file.h5")

3. hdf5load
-----------
3a. To load the variables from a hdf5 file called "file.h5" type:

 hdf5load("file.h5")
 
3b. To load a specific variable from a hdf5 file called "file.h5" type:

 hdf5load("file.h5","var2")

or:

 hdf5load("file.h5","var1","var2")   

3c. Names of variables to be loaded can also be specified using wildcards '*':

 hdf5load("file.h5","v*")   

3d. To load variables in a specific group  from a hdf5 file called "file.h5" 
type:

 hdf5load("file.h5",None,"/group1")

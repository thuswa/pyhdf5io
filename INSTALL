How to install 
==============

. Download pyhdf5io-0.1.tar.gz 
2. Unpack it. 
3. From the pyhdf5io-0.1 directory run:

>python setup.py install

This will copy the package to the appropriate directory for third-party
modules (/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/) in their Python installation.


Requires: PyTables 2.0.0 or greater
